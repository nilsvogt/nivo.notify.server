# LEMP stack on a virtual machine using Vagrant

This is how I set up a LEMP-Stack on a virtual machine for sandboxed projects. The Vagrantfile comes with a bootstrap.sh setting up everything you need on a virtual machine. Feel free to customize the bootstrapping to fit your needs.

## The setup installs and configures the tools below on a virtual ubuntu machine

- curl, zip, unzip
- nginx
- php7
- mysql
- xdebug
- phpunit
- git
- composer

Once the environment was successfully set up, the `bootstrap.sql` will be processed against mysql so thats a handy place to put a database dump in. Anyway, since this is optional you simply can remove this file if you do not need it.

# Setup

## customize the bootstrapping (optional)
You can customize the bootstrap configuration in `box-settings/config.sh` if the defaults do not match your requirements:

assign the root directory of your server:
> document_root="/vagrant/app/public"

set the database user:
> db_username="root"

set the database pass:
> db_password="root"

## create an entry in your hosts file (optional)

> 111.111.11.11	dev.local

run `vagrant up`

The vagrant box is now setting up the environment with the ip *111.111.11.11*
If not found the bootstrap.sh creates the public root for your application:

> app/public

and places an index.php outputting `phpinfo()` to demonstrate php is up and running.
